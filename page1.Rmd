```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


# Interactive plots
first let's make a ggplot of cars, speed vs. distance
```{r carsggplot,fig.cap="A simple ggplot of car speed vs. distance"}
#install plotly
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = cars, aes(x=speed, y= dist, color= speed))+ 
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)

```

```{r plotlycars, echo=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplotly(
  ggplot(data = cars, aes(x=speed, y= dist, color= speed))+ 
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)
)


```

-*eval=FALSE* is to sow code but not evaluate teh code
-*echo=TRUE/FALSE* is to show or not show the code

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
